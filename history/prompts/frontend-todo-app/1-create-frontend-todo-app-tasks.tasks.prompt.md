# Create Frontend Todo App Tasks

## User Input

```

```

## Response Summary

Generated a comprehensive task list for the Frontend Web Application for Multi-User Todo System with 41 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story priority:

- Phase 1: Setup tasks for initializing the Next.js project
- Phase 2: Foundational tasks for API client, auth context, and base components
- Phase 3: User Story 1 implementation for authentication (P1 priority)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 implementation for task management (P2 priority)
- Phase 5: User Story 3 implementation for UI responsiveness (P3 priority)
- Final Phase: Polish and cross-cutting concerns

Each task follows the required format with checkboxes, IDs, parallel markers ([P]), and user story labels ([US1], [US2], [US3]) where appropriate. The tasks are organized to enable independent implementation and testing of each user story.

## Outcome

Successfully created the tasks.md file with all required sections completed. The tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing, with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. Ready for the implementation phase.
